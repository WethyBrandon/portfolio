                        <p><i>Voyager - Designed Dreamer</i> is an animation that spans the trajectory and life span of the Voyager II probe. It follows the probe on it real-life journey through the solar system. I modeled the entirety of the solar system, as well as 25,000 individual asteroids, and rendered the animation out in the most photorealistic way possible with my hardware at the time. The animation itself took over 3 days to complete with an additional 16 hours for rendering. Fun fact: The radio advertisements at the beginning of the video were released on the same day as the Voyager II launch!

                            <i>Slasher Gasher</i> was my 4th film project in my University course for Film Production at Temple University. The objective of the project was to cut together various scenes from raw footage and blend them with a green screen effect. I decided to make it into an '80's slasher film-esque video due to the stalker-like camera movement. I took inspiration from my own interactions with horror movies and broke the 4th wall at the end. It was my attempt to make the video seem relatable to the audience.

                            <i>Loneliness - Montage Project</i> is another video editing project for my Film Production class at Temple University. The goal of the project was to take film provided by the professor and make a music video montage. Although many other students made their videos more in-line to a TikTok-style montage, I wanted to make the video more relatable instead. This was during the height of COVID-19, with everyone self-isolating, and the rampant loneliness that was effecting everyone was apparent. This video was made to bring a sort of catharsis to the pandemic and to share my own feelings of the time. In the end, it is supposed to emulate the feelings that everyone had during the extended isolation from human contact. I also did some foley work with the carrot cutting sound effect as well as the soda pour sound. (FYI that soda pouring sound effect came from a can of Mountain Dew)

The idea was to have a slow zoom in on the planet than a cut to the desert surface as ships lift off of the planet into space. I never finished the project as of yet, but the overall storyboard exists. However, this was just a quick test for the project.

                            <i>Kuleshov Effect</i> video is another project that was assigned to properly demonstrate the "Kuleshov Effect". This effect is an edit between various scene cut between a reaction from a human subject, the meaning inferred from the video is based solely on the expression of the subject. The meaning of the subjects reaction, it is thought, can change based on the video edited between the reations. This was my attempt. This, too, was filmed and edited during the COVID-19 self-isolation of 2020. It was my attempt to capture the same feelings that everyone experienced. In this video, it was my intention to show the subject viewing various video and photos to convey the longing and nostalgia for the outside world.

                            The <i>Star Trek: Continuum - Steam release Teaser</i> was the very first animation I ever made. This animation was developed to release on the 50th anniversary of Star Trek back in 2016. I animated this to announce that the mod that I volunteer for was going to release later that day on the Steam Workshop. I took me over a week to animated, texture, and edit this aniamtion. It also took 18 hours to render. Even though it isn't great, I am still proud of my work and maybe someday I will come back to it to improve it! Until then, I would say this was a solid animation back then and still is today. I stand by it!

                            <i>Blade Runner 2049 (Rough Draft)</i> was a film project for my Art of Film class in Lakeland University before my transfer to Temple University. The video is an analysis of the character K from the film <i>Blade Runner 2049</i> (2017). In the video, I postulate that despite being a replicant, artifical human, that K is <i>the</i> most human character in the film. Many of K's qualities like his humanity, empathy, and his capacity for love make him more human when in contrast to the <i>actual</i> humans presented in the film. The original film, <i>Blade Runner</i> (1982) is one of my all-time favorite films. Ridley Scott uses the film to ask the question, "What does it mean to be human?". Which is a great question in a world of so many artificial things, but it also applies to the real-world. However, that's a long-winded discussion for another time...

                            The <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation Parody</i> was a little project handed to me from my professor at Temple University to test the class' technical ability using green screen effects. I chose to do <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i> because I thought it would be funny, particularly this episode, <i>Darmok</i> (1991). This tickled my professor as he and I were of similar age and understood the reference, although I cannot say the same for my fellow students. My professor also laughed at my music choice as well because this was the third project I had submitted with him looking longingly at a camera accompanied by an '80's love power ballad. There is a particular nuance here that was lost on the other classmates, but the professor and I quite enjoyed it!

                            <i>Octopus Garden</i> was a result of a collaboration between myself and two other classmates. For this video, I wrote the story and planned to overall them of the video. My classmates filmed on location in Okinawa while I cut and edited it from my apartment in Tokyo. The animation I made of C'thulu for the video is pretty rough as I did not have a good deal of time to polish it. I am please on how the video turned out and it made several of the students in our class uncomfortable because of how creepy it was. That was great though, considering that it was exactly what we were going for. The idea evolved from just some guy falling into the bath tub and finding himself in the ocean into a cosmic-horror short film with all the essence of H.P. Lovecraft, and I love it!

                            <i>RiMe: An Allegory for Grief</i> was an analysis project much like my <i>Blade Runner 2049 (Rough Draft)</i> video above. In this case I decided to take some edit film from the gameplay I made for the game and cut it together. In my analysis I wanted to break down the game's more complex ideas and narrative. <i>RiME</i> is an incredibly underrated game with a melancholy story at its heart. It is absolutely a game I would reccommend for anyone that it looking to enjoy something with substance and something to say. It's definitely off the main stream and is at its core, a heartwrenching, impactful, and oddly cathartic experience that wallops you right in the heart.
