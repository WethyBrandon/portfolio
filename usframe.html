                       <p>
                        Ever since I was young, I have had a passion for games and entertainment. My first experiences as a child were learning DOS from my father so that I could play a <i>Donald Duck's Playground</i> on the Commodore 64. Since that time, I was entranced by games. Later in my life, my father gave me my first PC when I was eight years old, and with it the game <i>Star Trek: Judgement Rites </i>. These wouldn't be the last of the games I would play, no, no. They were the first amongst many. My passion grew deeper in the summer of '97 when I worked for a family friend's used video games shop> I had free reign to play whatever I wanted while waiting for customers and helping them buy games for their children. My knowledge of games and my relative experience being a child helped pursuade many parents to buy games I thought their children would love. I enjoyed spreading the enthusiasm I had for gaming to others whenever the opporitunity presented itself. And my passions only grew deeper in 2001 with the release of <i>Final Fantasy: Spirits Within</i>. I know that sounds strange, but I was already a fan of Squaresoft's art style, but watching the CG animation come to life, and it looked so realistic at the time, that I was enamored with the film. Of course, the writing for the film was something that needed more work, but the film worked on my prepubescent mind.</p>
                       <h3>Time Skip Warning!</h3>
                       <p>Later on in my life, I began wondering what I could do. Mind you, this was post high school. In this time, usually young kids such as myself at the time had already figured out their life path. I was conflicted, I enjoyed video games but it society was still in that akward phase of pretending that games were not a lucrative career choice. So, I shifted around from dream-to-dream trying to figure out my calling. That's when I discovered the modding communities online. Specifically the Star Trek: Continuum (Now Star Trek: Chronicles) on Moddb. And on the advice from a Twitter acquintance, Mike Game (Producer, Bioware Edmonton), I pursued a voluntary modding career(?).</p>
                       <p>It began in 2012. I first contacted the ST:C mod group and asked them if they needed any help, they responded enthusiastically and sent a project folder and told me to complete the project and send it back to them, I can only surmise that this was their application process. With some help from one of the members, I completed the project about 2 weeks later. This is when I was included into the process, if not without some hesitation from the then leader of the group. However, I was a full-fledged member about 2 years lagter in 2014. This is where the real work began. After learning some basics of 3D design and asset managment. The team and I were about to crunch our six month window to complete the ST:C [Gamma] version release. We added over 250+ ships into the game and over 5GB worth of data. But nothing was more stressfull or more fulfilling to see the reaction we recieved from the community. Later that year, we won the 2015 Moddb Editor's Choice Mod of the Year Award and the 2015 Best Overhaul Mod of the Year Award. Of course, I was both flabbergasted and humbled, considering 2015 was the same year <i>Enderal</i>, a HUGE mod for <i>Skyrim</i>, released to the satisfaction and cheers of the modding community for its own achievments. So, imagine my surprise when we beat out THAT mod.</p>
                       <p style="margin-bottom: 15vh;">From here, my real journey began. In so many years that it took for my to find my passion, I realised how much games and their stories meant to me. That's when I decided to chase after my dream. It took me a few years to set myself up financially to make it happen, but I did it. I was able to go to Temple University in 2018. From there I worked my hardest to maintain my grades so that I could see my vision of the future through. I eventually graduated with B.A. in Communications majoring in Film and Media Production, mostly due to a lack of an existing Game Design program. In my years spent in the pursuit of my goal, I have taught myself, and have been taught, a varied array of information. I ammassed all of this knowledge to use in future. I want people to experience the same joys as I did growing up and playing games; the narratives, the gameplay, the fun. It would be a fulfillment of an entire life's work to be a part of a development studio.
